Rust project 1 : list primes
Write a program to list all primes between 2 user-input whole numbers.
Provide a count of the number found and of the number of non- primes. Allow user to choose to
include 1 as a prime or not. Default to not.
Output: format the output in a number of columns depending on the maximum size to be shown,
with numbers output across the screen.
OPTIONAL Provide output to .csv file and .html for browser display.
UI clear screen. Print title. "List primes between two numbers".
User entry fields for first and second number, option to include 1, output choices if required.
State upper limit if nec.
Input can be by sequential prompts with entry fields following and navigation kept simple, but
more friendly options my be provided if desired, such as ability to change a response, to start
over or to quit at any time.
Validate that user entered data is correct. Numbers are in range and different.
Decide and state whether user bounds are included in the determination, either, both or none.
Decide policy on zero.
